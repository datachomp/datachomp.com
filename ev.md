Nice: 
so much fun to drive
maintenance is really nice
auto driving is nice when everything works
amazing for driving around the city
When your behavior matches what the software wants - it feels magical
Nice HUDs - minimal but information dense. This is way better than distracting infotainment


Not good: 
everything in units of 1 instead of 1/4 or 1/8 - not adjustable

distance being variable up to 35%

software is so dumb
	doesn't want to necessarily work with other software
	Everything is digital/dynamic interface, but personalization is deeply superficial
	remote software calls are unreliable/unresponsive... and usually unactionable.

touch is so dumb, slow, unecessary 

public charging sucks. questionable availability/functionality/speed/scummy apps
	variable charge time sucks with passengers

Because of a few of the aboves, it is hard to travel reasonable distances with predictable or convient time reporting ot other people

Nice HUDs have really expensive windshields
